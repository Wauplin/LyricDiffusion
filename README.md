Imagine an app that takes a song name, magically extracts the lyrics from the song, intelligently splits them into meaningful parts, and then goes a step further by generating visually appealing images for each lyric. 
These images are not just ordinary images; they are crafted using cutting-edge Stable Diffusion AI, ensuring a unique and artistic representation for every part of the song. 
It's like turning your favorite lyrics into a visual masterpiece, all with the power of technology.
The good news is that it's completely free because it uses the local hardware instead of APIs.
